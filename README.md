# I-Rent

(Python Tuwaiq academy Final Project)


#Description of my website project:

It is the best place to get what you wish for free!
My website will give you the chance to rent an item from another user for a replacement of your own item. 
You can search for your wanted item, and contact the user for a possible exchange of your item. 
The journey starts by creating a new user with your personaldetails. After that, you would add your item information.
